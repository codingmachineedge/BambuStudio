# Windows features

- [Native Material Design 3 UI](md3-native-ui.md)
- [English, Hong Kong Cantonese, and bilingual modes](language-modes.md)
- [Native visual smoke test](native-visual-smoke.md)

Windows is the active release target for this fork. macOS and Linux source support remains upstream,
but those platforms are not part of the fork's release acceptance gate.

No Postman collection is applicable: the native application exposes no HTTP API. The `DeviceWeb`
sub-project (`src/slic3r/GUI/DeviceWeb/`) is an in-app webview front-end bundled with the
application, not a served HTTP API; this repository publishes no API contract for it, so no Postman
collection exists for it either.
