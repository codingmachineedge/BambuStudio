# BambuStudio
Bambu Studio is a cutting-edge, feature-rich slicing software.  
It contains project-based workflows, systematically optimized slicing algorithms, and an easy-to-use graphic interface, bringing users an incredibly smooth printing experience.

This fork's maintained delivery target is the native Material Design 3 Windows application. The
[latest Windows installer](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/BambuStudio/releases/latest/download/BambuStudioMD3-Setup.exe)
is a per-user install and does not require administrator elevation. It is currently unsigned; verify
the accompanying
[SHA-256 file](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/BambuStudio/releases/latest/download/BambuStudioMD3-Setup.exe.sha256)
before running it. Upstream cross-platform releases remain available from
[Bambu Lab](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/releases/), but macOS and Linux are outside this
fork's release acceptance gate.

The Windows UI provides three canonical fork modes: English (`en`), playful Hong Kong Cantonese
preview (`yue_HK`), and compact English + Cantonese preview (`bilingual_en_yue_HK`). Existing Bambu Studio
locales remain available. Missing Cantonese copy falls back to English; native bilingual presentation
is opt-in on migrated surfaces, and the Cantonese catalog remains a curated preview pending broader
human review. See the
[language-mode documentation](docs/features/windows/language-modes.md) for coverage and fallback
details.

## Native Material Design 3

The production wxWidgets application is being rewritten around Material Design 3 roles and
interaction patterns. The native source includes Material top-level navigation and menus,
responsive Prepare controls, a vertical transform-tool rail, contextual Preview controls, and
card-based Device controls. Local Release install and full-compositor native smoke evidence was
reviewed on 2026-07-20; this is not a published-release claim.

### Verified installed-app captures

These are full-display compositor captures of the locally installed native executable, not
`ui-md3` reference images. They show the real Home surface, signed-out Filament Manager, official
Device plug-in boundary, and local Git-backed Version History dialog.

### Interactive design reference

The images below are deterministic captures of the separate [`ui-md3`](ui-md3/) interactive design
reference, not screenshots of the native application. Select an image to open the same reference
screen, theme, density, accent, and language state. Verified native captures will be added after the
current Release build and desktop smoke pass.

## Project history

The native app includes app-local, Git-backed version history for `.3mf` projects. Each retained
revision is a complete project snapshot in an isolated bare repository below Bambu Studio's data
directory, never a `.git` directory beside the user's project. Automatic edits and completed manual
saves are queued in order; identical snapshots are suppressed. **File → Version history** lists and
restores revisions without directly overwriting the saved project, and **Save As** forks the existing
history to the new project identity when it is safe to do so.

History is local to this device: it is not pushed to the source-code repository, synced to another
computer, or a replacement for backups. There is not yet a retention or pruning policy, so storage
can grow with project size and edit count. A restore changes the open session; the project file is
only replaced when the user explicitly saves it.

The Windows pipeline builds and tests the native application, exercises installer upgrade
and recovery behavior on a disposable GitHub-hosted runner, produces a per-file CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM,
and creates GitHub provenance and SBOM attestations for the installer. It validates all three assets
in a draft before publication and refuses to publish unless repository immutable releases are
enabled. The current Material and project-history changes still require a successful final workflow
run before they become release evidence. GitHub attestations and checksums are not Authenticode
signatures; configuring a trusted
Windows signing identity remains external work. Local focused validation on commit
`3b00dc6aa` passed `language_mode_tests`, `project_history_tests`, and
`deterministic_bbs_3mf_tests` (3/3). This focused gate is not the full aggregate suite: the
upstream aggregate `libslic3r_tests` has current API-drift compile failures and `libnest2d_tests`
has known baseline runtime failures, so both are explicitly waived from this branch gate pending
upstream repair. The prior branch run failed before C++ tests on DeviceWeb's `js-yaml` advisory;
the lock override is repaired and the replacement run is tracked in [Actions](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/BambuStudio/actions/runs/29806330072).

Bambu Studio is based on [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer) by Prusa Research, which is from [Slic3r](https://github.com/Slic3r/Slic3r) by Alessandro Ranellucci and the RepRap community.

See this fork's [wiki](https://github.com/Ding-Ding-Projects/BambuStudio/wiki),
[feature documentation](docs/README.md), [roadmap](ROADMAP.md), and [handoff](HANDOFF.md) for the
MD3 rewrite, verification status, and Windows release details. The original documentation remains in
[`doc/`](doc/).

# How to compile on Windows

Use the upstream
[Windows compile guide](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/wiki/Windows-Compile-Guide) for a
developer build. The fork's release configuration is encoded in
[`.github/workflows/build_bambu.yml`](.github/workflows/build_bambu.yml) and is orchestrated by
[`.github/workflows/build_all.yml`](.github/workflows/build_all.yml). The release workflow enables
native C++ tests and packages the installed payload with NSIS; see the
[Windows CI and supply-chain documentation](docs/features/releases/windows-release-supply-chain.md)
before treating a local build as equivalent to a published artifact.
